# Host operations

Host-local scheduler, cron visibility, session maintenance and launcher wiring.
These commands may read OpenClaw runtime state and the KCNyu schedule contract;
they must not implement portfolio or workflow semantics.

Common read-only entry points:

```bash
bash ops/host/check_crons.sh
bash ops/host/check_crons.sh --timeline
python3 ops/host/cron_health_check.py
```
